## Handwritten History: Automated Digitization and Transcription of Historical Documents
### MSDS696 â€“ Data Science Practicum II
The goal for this project was to see if I could build an effective optical character recognition model to offer the Windsor Art & Heritage Center of Colorado for their large collection of historical city documents. I went with Tensorflow and Keras as they were ranked highest for free models that excel at handwriting OCR. 
With a parternship with The Windsor Art & Heritage Center, I was given hundreds of thousands of pages with no transcription. These books are over a hundred years old and are starting to really show their age and succumb to the elements so the clock is ticking. I wanted to see how well we can leverage deep learning to ensure history is not lost. While I didn't quite get there over the course of the course, I'm continuing my work on it in hopes of delivering a standalone model that be given to museums for transcription.
### Training
I attempted three different levels of training the model based on epochs.
#### 60 Epochs
